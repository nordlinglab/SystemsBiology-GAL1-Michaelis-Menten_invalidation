Repository for the article Investigating GAL1 expression in budding yeast: a multi-dataset study of Michaelisâ€“Menten model invalidation

For the 3ODEs model, we provide the following resources:  
1. The 50 initial guess sets for model parameters.  
2. The running code files for the AMIGO2 toolbox in MATLAB.  
3. Results for all Training-Testing combinations.  

The computations are completed with MATLAB and the AMIGO2 Toolbox.
The full tutorial for downloading, installing, and operating the AMIGO2 Toolbox can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox/download?authuser=0).
