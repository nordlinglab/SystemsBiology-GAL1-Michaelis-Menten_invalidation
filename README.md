Repository for the article Investigating GAL1 expression in budding yeast: a multi-dataset study of Michaelisâ€“Menten model invalidation

For the 3ODEs model, we provide the following resources:  
1. The 4 datasets for parameter estimation and model invalidation
2. The 50 initial guess sets for model parameters.  
3. The running code files for the AMIGO2 toolbox in MATLAB.  
4. Results for all Training-Testing combinations.  

The computations are completed with MATLAB and the AMIGO2 Toolbox.
The full tutorial for downloading, installing, and operating the AMIGO2 Toolbox can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox/download?authuser=0).
